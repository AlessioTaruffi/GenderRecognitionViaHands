# CNN for Hand-Based Binary Gender Classification

This repository contains the implementation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) system designed to classify gender based on hand images. 
Leveraging the LeNet and AlexNet architectures, the system focuses on hand morphology and texture, achieving high classification accuracy through preprocessing and model optimization.
The CNN was developed as part of the "Foundamentals of Data Science" course at Sapienza University of Rome during the academic year of 2024/25
